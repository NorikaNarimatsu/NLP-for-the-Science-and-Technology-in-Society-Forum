STATEMENT 
 
 
The 2nd Annual Meeting of the Scie nce and Technology in Society  forum  was 
held from September 11th to 13th, with the participation of approximately 500 
leading scientists, policymaker s, business executives and opinion leaders from 
68 countries and regions. His Imperial Highness The Crown Prince of Japan 
attended the opening ceremo ny and expressed his supp ort for the aims of the 
forum , and Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi noted the importance of using 
science and technology to ensure mank ind’s future prosperity. Stimulating 
discussions and exchanges of views on the lights and shadows of science and 
technology took place from the standpoint  of the future of humankind. The main 
points of the discussions were as follows.  
 The key to future sustainability is for humankind to live in harmony with the 
environment. We recognized the necessity to develop a practical and effective 
framework that all countries will participate in, to deal with CO2 emissions and 
other climate-forcing emissions.  
While we agree that it is necessary to further develop renewable energy 
sources, such as solar, biomass and hydrogen, a common recognition was also 
attained that the use of nuclear fission po wer, under strict co nditions of safety 
and non-proliferation, is very important, and investment to develop and 
implement nuclear fusion power for the future is essential. 
 
We feel it important to try to establish common international rules or standards 
concerning bioethics that will enable rese archers in all countr ies to collaborate 
and have the opportunity to be equally productive in their research activities. 
 We reached a consensus on the furt her development of  Information and 
Communications Technology or ICT, to build a thriving future for humankind. 
Most participants agreed that interopera bility, security and privacy protection 
are imperative for progress toward an info rmation society. We  also recognized 
the importance of digital archiving for giving everyone equal access to science 
and technology knowledge. Resolving the digital divide issue will be of common 
benefit to humankind.    
Science and Technology in Society forum                                    September 13, 2005  
 2It was agreed that creating opportunities for universal access  to education, 
regardless of gender, race or national or igin, is vital for our future. Education, 
from primary schooling to advanced studies, must be carried out under a 
rigorous environment which enables all students to develop their potential. 
 The idea of establishing a global, integr ated system of intellectual property 
rights was proposed and received the support of many participants. 
 We reached a common consensus that we  should try to prevent the use of 
science and technology by terrorists and also develop measures for using 
science and technolog y to defend against terrorism.   
 We recognized that developing vacci nes and medical therapies against 
infectious diseases like AIDS  is crucial for mankind’s future and is one of the 
most important fields where science and technology can make a contribution.   
 Moreover, in order to protect our fellow ci tizens against natural disasters, all of 
us agreed on the strong necessity for in ternational cooperation to establish 
early warning, human safety  and rescue systems and the more efficient use of 
science and technology toward that end.  
 In the field of development assist ance, most of us acknowledged the 
importance of offering science and technology-related aid, together with 
capacity building. 
 Every year, science and technology brings new disc overies and innovations 
that influence our lives, society and culture. We acknowledged that the forum  
serves as an important venue for exchanging views on the latest developments 
in this field and their impact on humankind.    
It is important for all people, regardless of  their background, to consider science 
and technology issues as their own. Recognizing that bo th the lights and 
shadows of science and technology will have a great impact on the human race, 
we agreed that science and technology should not control humankind; 
humankind should control science and technology.  
 It was decided, at a Council Meeting during the forum , to establish a non-profit 
organization that will manage the forum . We also agreed to hold an STS forum  
every year in Kyoto and the next one will be held from September 10
th to 12th, 
2006. "

STATEMENT 
1. The 3rd Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society 
forum was held from September 10 to  12, with the participation of 
approximately 600 leading scientists, policymakers, business executives 
and opinion leaders from 70 countrie s, regions and international 
organizations. Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, representing the Japanese government, noted the import ance of dialogue and cooperation 
among science, business and politic s, and of bringing together 
knowledge, wealth and power to co ntribute to society. Stimulating 
discussions and exchanges of views on the lights and shadows of 
science and technology took place fr om the standpoint of the future of 
humankind. The main points of the discussions were as follows.   
2. It is critical for humankind to achieve sustainable development by 
striking a good balance between econom ic activity and environment 
protection. We recognized the importance of acting on climate change and agreed on the need to  reduce greenhouse gases but want to go 
beyond the Kyoto Protocol, for a new, practical and effective framework in 
which all countries, including the United States, China and India, will participate. 
  
3. We believe it is necessary to make rapid progress in energy efficiency, 
and to further develop alternative energy sources. We also recognized 
that the use of nuclear fission power, under strict conditions of safety and 
non-proliferation, must play an increasingly important role. Furthermore, it 
is essential to invest in deve loping and implementing nuclear fusion 
power for the future. 
  4. The life sciences, particularly in the post-genome era, raise many 
opportunities and challenges related to  protection of intellectual property, 
data sharing and ethics. We feel it is important to increase funds for basic 
research and to maintain incentives  for academic and private research 
and to establish common international rules or standards that will enable 
researchers in all countries to coll aborate in their research activities.

5. We recognized that developing va ccines and medical therapies against 
infectious diseases such as AIDS, av ian flu, malaria and tuberculosis is 
vital for mankind’s future and requires urgent action. In addition, we need 
infrastructure for distribution of me dicines and information exchange, as 
well as preparedness for fut ure pandemic outbreaks.   
 6. We acknowledged that  crop production must be increased to feed the 
growing human population. Sciences hould be employed to enhance food 
security, particularly in the developing world, where many people face 
food and water shortages. We also shared a common view on the necessity of making water technologies, including water purification and 
desalinization, available. 
 7. We reached a consensus that furt her development of Information and 
Communications Technology or ICT is necessary, to build a thriving future 
for humankind. We agreed that the current open global net work has great 
value from the standpoint of bui lding a knowledge-based society. 
Reducing the vulnerabilities of networ ks and ensuring privacy are also of 
vital importance. We believe that acce ss to scientific information is so 
critical that it must be as  complete as possible.  
 
8. Since science and technology are essential for the effective 
socio-economic advancement of the developing countries, we acknowledge the importance of more international science and 
technology collaboration in the form of joint research and capacity 
building. Appropriate development assistance  resources should be 
allocated for this purpose. 
 
9. Many participants also supported the idea of beginning discussions to 
establish a global, integrated system of intellectual property rights.  
 
10. Universities, in addition to their primary role of educating students, should play an important role in cont ributing to economic development by 
promoting innovation through busi ness - academia collaboration. 
Therefore, we reached a consensus on the need for improving the 
research environment and promoting system  reforms in universities. We 
also agreed on the importance of encouraging the full and equal 
integration of female researchers in the field of science and technology. 
  
Science and Technology in Society forum  September 12, 2006

 311. We shared the view that new breakthroughs in science and 
technology, for example nanotechnol ogy, biotechnology, and ICT, will be 
so significant that they should be used effectively for the benefit of 
humankind.  
12. We also noted that policy-makers and people working in the media 
play an important role in enco uraging general scientific literacy. 
Reinforcing math and science education is also vital.  
13. Although these issues  are not easy to solve in  the short term, we 
acknowledged that we should not give  up our efforts to address these 
challenges. It is true that science and technology have become so 
advanced that we are prone to feel as if humankind can control the globe 
at will. We need to think seriously about what humankind and the globe should be like in 50 or even 100 years from now. science and technology 
should not control humankind; humank ind should control science and 
technology. It is important for all peop le, not only professional scientists 
but also legislators, business lead ers and opinion makers, to think of 
science and technology issues as their own. We  acknowledged that the 
forum serves as an important venue where people, regardless of race, 
nationality and culture, exchange views on how to deal with science and 
technology issues from the long-r ange perspective of humankind.  
 14. We also agreed to hold the next STS forum in Kyoto from October 7 to 
9, 2007. We look forward for all to join us then to pursue our endeavors to 
understand the lights and shadows of science and technology as we seek 
to harness new knowledge for a better future of humankind in harmony 
with nature.

4th Annual Meeting 
October 9, 2007 (Embargo until 12:00 noon) 
Kyoto, Japan 
 
STATEMENT 
 
1．The 4th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum  
was held from October 7-9, with the participation of over 600 leading 
scientists, policymakers, business exec utives and media leaders from 71 
countries, regions and international organizations. Prime Minister Yasuo 
Fukuda stressed the need to make the transition to a sustainable society 
through empowerment by sc ience and technology. 
This year’s STS forum  held discussions about science and technology 
under the main themes of “Harmony with Nature” and “Innovation.” We agreed upon the following. 
 
2. We recognized the importance of acting on climate change and agreed 
on the need to establish a new in ternational framework which would 
replace the Kyoto Protocol, in which a ll countries will participate. The STS 
forum  has been advocating this post- Kyoto process since 2004, and we 
highly value the fact that  a consensus is shaping  in the international 
community toward the participation of  all countries. We expect further 
concrete dialogue to be conducted at the G8 summit and other 
international fora.  
3. We believe it is necessary to make rapid progress in energy efficiency, 
and to further develop a broad range of  clean alternative energy sources, 
in view of the expected increa se in global energy needs and of 
environmental concerns. The use of nuc lear fission power, under strict 
conditions of safety and non-proliferation, must play an increasingly 
important role. Furthermore, it is essent ial to invest in developing nuclear 
fusion power for the future. 
 4. Water, whether it is for drinking or for agriculture, is now one of the 
most pressing global issues we must deal with. We recognize that 
science and technology can contribute more for solutions to this crucial 
problem facing humankind.  
5. Life sciences, particularly in the genome era, offer enormous promise 
to benefit humankind, though there are ethical concerns in some  
 
Science and Technology in Society forum  October 9, 2007

 2 applications. We recognize that res earch in this field, including 
international collaboration, is very active. In this regard, we feel it is 
desirable to establish international standards that will enable researchers 
all over the world to conduct research on an equal footing. 
 6. With increasing population, richer  diets and the demand for biofuels, 
the food supply is facing a serious crisis. The best of science, including all 
the possibilities of the new biology, must be brought to bear on increasing 
agricultural productivity.  
7. We shared the view that breakt hroughs in nanotechnology have the 
potential to significantly benefit human kind. However, their possible risks 
should be analyzed in advance and minimized. 
 
8. We reached a consensus that furt her development of Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) is nec essary to build a thriving future 
for humankind. The recent surge in  computational capabilities is 
expanding the reach of science further, and new applications may have a major impact on society. We endorse the need for an open Internet, and 
for effective measures and tec hnologies to safeguard personal data. 
 9. Prevention of major infectious diseases through vaccine development 
and other means is vital for humankind's future and requires urgent action. 
In addition, we need mechanisms for effective vaccine distribution and 
information exchange, as well as  surveillance and preparedness for 
future pandemics. 
 
10. Joint research in developing countries should be encouraged with the 
participation of researc hers and scientists from  developed countries. A 
portion of official development assi stance (ODA) should be used for this 
activity, to harness the human potential of  developing countries in addition 
to the financial power of developed countries. 
The STS forum  recommends to the G8 countr ies that they discuss this 
proposal at their Summit meeting in 2008.  
11. Intellectual property rights prot ection is essential to encourage new 
discoveries and their application. However, the current global system 
needs to be improved.   
12. Universities, whose primary functions are educating students and 
advancing knowledge, should play an important role in contributing to 
socio-economic development by  promoting innovation through 
business-academia-governm ent collaboration.   
 
Science and Technology in Society forum  October 9, 2007

13. Science and technology have be come so advanced that some are 
inclined to think that humankind can control nature; however, we should 
not forget that humankind is part of  nature, and that we should live in 
harmony with nature. While the appl ication of science and technology 
may have negative aspects, we  must recognize that there is no solution to 
these problems without further development of science and technology. 
 14. Innovation must be nurtured. It depends on creativity, which is enhanced by educational systems that encourage inquiry and research 
that explores unconventional ideas.  New ideas emerging in basic and 
applied research in both private and public institutions should be 
transformed, whenever possible, into  products that benefit society.  
 
15. We agreed to hold the Fifth Annual Meeting of the STS forum  in Kyoto 
from Sunday, October 5 to Tuesday, October 7, 2008. We look forward for 
all to join us then to pursue our en deavors to understand the lights and 
shadows of science and technology as we se ek to harness new 
knowledge for a better future of humankind in harmony with nature.

5th Annual Meeting 
October 7, 2008 (Embargo until 12:30) 
Kyoto, Japan 
STATEMENT 
 
 
1. The 5th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum  
was held from October 5 to 7. Over 750 leading scientists, policymakers, 
business executives and media leaders gathered from 91 countries, 
regions and internati onal organizations. This year’s STS forum  discussed 
science and technology under the main  theme “Harmony with Nature.” 
We agreed upon the following. 
 2. Harmony with nature is the most important challenge for humankind. We 
have been discussing global environmental problems every year at the 
STS forum  and stressed the need to es tablish a new international 
post-Kyoto framework in which all countries, including the United States, China and India, will participate. We welcomed the G8 leaders’ shared 
view of seeking to adopt a global target for reducing emissions of 
greenhouse gases. The time has come to enact an action plan to solve 
this problem. 
 3. Given the growing global demand for energy, rapid progress in energy 
efficiency, conservation and clean alternative energy development are indispensable. Among these,  we agreed that nuclear power is crucially 
important. We recognized that we should increase the implementation of fission power, under strict conditions of nuclear safeguards, safety and 
security. The development of nuclear fusion power is also essential for 
the future. 
 4. Biofuels have been developed as alt ernatives to fossil fuels, but we 
should recognize their potentially adverse effects on global food and 
environmental problems. Therefore, research and development in 
technologies for non-subsidized second-generation biofuels from non-food sources should be promoted.

http://www.stsforum.org    Final Version
5. Given the growing number of the hun gry and the unstable food supply, we 
believe expansion of food production is  an urgent priority , particularly in 
the developing world. Therefore, both GMO and non-GMO research should be promoted by paying attention to safety while continuing to 
make efforts to gain public acceptance. 
 6. In line with the significant progress made in genome research, we agreed 
that personalized medicine should be emphasized and international 
standards for privacy protection are needed. We also expect that the rate 
of advancement in preventive medicine will be accelerated. 
 7. We reached consensus that ICT sh ould be used extensively to enable 
solutions to problems of the global  environment, educati on and health, 
and to contribute to business inno vation. The digital divide must be 
addressed. We should also pursue enhanced efficiency in ICT 
applications while ensuring that public concerns over the security, privacy 
and use of personal data are met. 
 8. Keeping in mind that the intellectual  property (IP) system is essential for 
innovation, we should pursue a co mprehensive strategic approach for the 
establishment of a worldwide pro-innovation IP infrastructure to drive the 
advancement of science  and technology for global socio-economic 
development. 
 9. It is important to enc ourage joint research in devel oping countries with the 
participation of researchers and scient ists from developed countries. We 
recommend collaboration with developed nations, in addition to using Official Development Assistance (ODA ), for joint research to mobilize and 
empower the human potential of developing countries. In this regard, we 
welcome the adoption of a new in itiative of science and technology 
diplomacy by the Japanese government. 
 10. In addition to meetings of science and technology ministers and university 
presidents, the program incl uded for the first time this year a meeting of 
academy presidents and a session of y oung scientists and engineers. We 
believe that the STS forum  has been evolving and is becoming more 
influential in decision-making for the future of humankind.

11. Realizing that the development of  science and technology now has an 
important impact on society, we concluded that there should be more 
direct dialogue between political leaders and scientists, and that scientists should be involved in policy formulation. As part of this process, policymakers should bring the needs of society to the attention of 
scientists and properly reflect accumulated scientific knowledge in their 
policies. Scientists should actively propose policy recommendations 
based on their scientific knowle dge. The general public needs to 
understand and support science and technology, and the media will have 
an increasingly important role to play in this exchange.  
 12. We consider the forum  to be an important venue for learning about and 
discussing the latest developments in science and technology, and how 
they affect human society. Rec ognizing that both the lights and the 
shadows of science and technology have a great impact on humankind, 
and that we share a common destiny on Earth, it is important for people of 
all backgrounds, regardless of race, nationality or gender, to consider 
these issues as their own. We agreed that we should try our utmost to 
accumulate knowledge and understanding, and use them wisely, in order 
to survive and prosper.  
 13. We agreed to hold the 6
th Annual Meeting of the STS forum  in Kyoto from 
October 4 to 6, 2009. We look forw ard to meeting here again to contribute 
to building a better future for humankind in harmony with nature.

6th Annual Meeting 
October 6, 2009 (Embargo until 12:30) 
Kyoto, Japan 
STATEMENT 
 
 
1.  The 6th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society (STS) forum  was held from 
October 4 to 6. Over 800 scient ists, policymakers, business exec utives and media leaders gathered 
from 85 countries, regions and international organizations. We agreed upon the following. 
 
2.  We stressed the need, as we have in the past, to  establish a new post-Kyoto Protocol framework in 
which all the countries of  the world, including the United States, China and India, will participate. We 
hope that our message will be reflected in the discu ssions at the United Na tions Climate Change 
Conference (COP 15) in December 2009 in copenhagen, and that an agree ment will be reached to 
establish an international framework for effect ively mitigating greenhouse gas emissions that 
includes all countries. 
 
3.  We discussed the need for more support from the developed countries for the developing countries 
to strengthen their capacities  and human capital for science and technology, in addition to financial 
assistance, to contribute to the growth and progress of the developing countries.  We welcome that 
Japan and other countries have adopted science and technology diplomacy toward developing 
countries. 
 
4.  Despite the severe economic recession that has put strains on national budgets, we must maintain 
investment in science and tec hnology and continue to promote science and technology as the 
driving force for economic recovery and sustainable growth. 
 5.  Rapid progress in improving energy effi ciency and conservation, and clean alternative energy 
development, are essential. We agr eed that nuclear power is cruc ially important to decreasing 
carbon emissions. We recognized that we should increase the im plementation of fission power, 
under strict conditions of nuclear  safeguards, safety and security, including the management of 
waste streams. We must increase the capacity for producing nuclear fission power plants based on 
existing technologies while at the same time ex pand research into next-generation systems. The 
development of nuclear fusion power  should be pursued for the future. 
 
6.  The increased risk of nuclear proliferation has become a critical issue for the future of humankind. 
It is vital for us to address this threat and take decisive steps to prevent proliferation. 
 
7.  Regarding alternative energy, we recognized that transportation is still  highly dependent on fossil 
fuels, and we reached a consensus that it is important to develop electric and fuel cell vehicles as 
soon as possible, provided that the power sources used reduce the carbon footprint without 
reducing the food supply. 
 
8.  A new international system is needed to enhance collaboration between industry, the WHO and 
nation-states to fight infectious  diseases, including the H1N1 flu pandemic, through measures such 
as more education, targeted res earch, and more effective developm ent and distribution of vaccines 
and medicines.  Health service capacity in the developing countries must be strengthened. 
 9.  Population growth, climate change and greater use and improvement of health care services will 
increase the cost burden to society. New systems of health provision based on technologies such as 
genomics and regenerative medicine represented by stem cells must be fully explored. We also 
expect that the rate of progress in preventive medicine will be accelerated. STS forum  2009  October 6, 2009 
www.stsforum.org

10. In response to the serious food supply crisis caused by the worl d’s increasing population, richer and 
more varied diets and the demand for biofuel s, as well as climate change and environmental 
degradation, we should support agricul tural research and extension, more resilient crops, better 
farming systems and more effective distribution syst ems. We should also promote the use of GMOs 
under strict conditions of safety. 
 
11. Clean water availability is now one of the most pressing global iss ues we must deal with. Science 
and technology has played an important role in des alination, recycling and water purification. We 
should further promote research and development in this field. 
 12. While the mitigation of global climate change due to emissions of greenhouse gases is essential, 
immediate adaptation measures to minimize human suffering must be pursued in parallel, locally 
and regionally. This is especially important for wa ter. Management of water is inherently regional 
and local. Regional models based on better locally produced monitoring data can guide local action. 
We must think globally, asse ss regionally and act locally. 
 13. We shared the view that the resolution of  analytical models and monitoring systems used to 
produce regional climate assessments must be improved. This will require a commitment to 
significantly improve worldwide capacity, space, air, ground and ocean monitoring.  
 
14. We reached a consens us that further development of In formation and Communi cations Technology 
(ICT) is essential for improving human lives and promoting economic grow th. We should be wise 
enough to utilize the cutting edge of ICT such as cloud computing, while ensuring that public 
concerns over the security, priv acy and use of personal data are met. We also discussed that the 
fusion of mobile robotics technology and IT has the potential to be of great service to humankind. 
 
15.  We agreed that we should further promote international cooperation to establish a global, 
integrated system of intellectual  property rights (IPR).  The long overdue first step is harmonization 
of patentability standards and the introduction of a general grace per iod after publication. Respect 
for IPR and standardization of fundamental  technology are essential for the  dissemination and 
application of the knowledge brought  by science and technology. Moreover, it is necessary to make 
further efforts to protect against IPR infringement  for the sound development  of the world economy. 
 
16. We confirmed the important role  of universities in contributing to socio-economic development and 
enhancing responsible citizenshi p. Business-academia-government  collaboration significantly 
contributes to advancing science and technology.  Math and science education at all levels is vital 
for promoting scientific literac y and an informed democracy. 
 
17. We noted the importance of fair  and objective reporting by the media on the lights and shadows of 
science and technology with regard to public policy iss ues. For that purpose, it is very important to 
stimulate continuing exchanges between scientists and the media. 
 
18. The STS forum  is not only a conference but also a move ment for global leaders in the business, 
government, science and media fields , and we expect that the support of the participants in this 
forum will broaden this movement and carry its me ssage to other venues in the world. We look 
forward to meeting again to contribute to building a better future for humankind in harmony with 
nature.

reminding us that  we are part of nature and that we should live in harmony with nature, as we cope 
with population growth and reduce the in equities between people. Sustainability has become 
crucially important . We need to adopt appropriate national policies and to strengthen the ability of 
the international community to handle global issues.  
 
3. It is regrettable that no  consensus was reached on establishing a new Post-Kyoto Protocol  
framework at COP 15  in 2009. It is urgent and vital to establish an  effective international 
framework to address climate change that includes all countries of the world and provides for both  
mitigation and adaptation.  
 
4. We reaffirmed  the need to advance science and technology diplomacy, including increased use of 
science and technology resources in addition to financial resources, for the benefit of developing 
countries.  Funding agencies should finance international science collaborations . All of that, and 
the promotion of entrepreneurs in starting small  and medium  enterprises , will have a great impact  
on capacity building in developing countries.  
 
5. Energy is essential to human society, but greater efficiency and a multi -path approach are needed 
for the provision of clean energy . We agreed that nuclear power , capable of producing energy on a 
mass scale,  is a crucially important  option for sustainability  under strict conditions of nuclear 
safeguards, safety and security,  including the management  of waste streams. To ensure the 
peaceful use of nuclear power , it is vital to take decisive steps to prevent nuclear proliferation.  
 
6. With more than half the world ’s population already living in cities, rapid urbanization is raising 
transportation, sanitation and other  challenges . We must rise to  these challenges and promote 
more efficient and humane cities through the use of science and technology  and urban planning.  
 
7. To ease food suppl y and demand issues  caused by the world ’s growing population, it is important 
to support agricultural R&D, plant more resilient crops , and implement  better farming and 
distribution systems. GMOs are also expected to contribute to solve this issue.  
 
8. Global health problems remain one of the most important issues of humankind. Technologies such 
as genomic and regenerative medicine must be fully explored for a new healthcare system. 
Progress in preventive medicine should be  accelerated .

9. A new international system for responding to infectious diseases is needed for better  collaboration 
between industry  and the public sector , including the WH O. Health service  capacity in the 
developing countries must be strengthened.  
 
10. The aging of the population poses special challenges  and opportunities , not just in providing 
geriatric care or social safety nets, but also in rethinking the social context of the participation of 
the elderly as productive citizens.  
 
11. The future Internet , with the semantic W eb and personalized mobile  access for all , opens 
enormous opportunities provided that public concerns over the security, privacy and use of 
personal data are addressed.  Creating an effective ICT infrastructure is critical for redressing  
disparities among and within nations in access to education, healthcare and business  
opportunities . 
 
12. Collaboration among academia, industr y, philanthropy  and government contributes to maintaining 
economic and social vitality. U niversities and research institutions should provide basic research,  
advanced results of R&D stimul ating innovation, as well as science and engineering education.  
Universities are the hub that links the humanities and science, promoting critical thinking and 
preparing students to be responsible global citizens.  Supporting education and research and local 
entrepreneurs creating spin- offs are essential for capacity -building in developing countries.  
 13. We welcome the conclusions of the  adjunct session on Regional Climate Change to implement 
knowledge action networks to assist those who are at risk  in adapting to the devastating impacts of 
global climate change.  
 
14. We hope that  fruitful  discussions at the Convention on Biological Diversity  (COP10) in Nagoya, 
Japan in October 2010 will result in effective action toward preserving biodiversity . 
 15. We noted the importance of fair and objective reporting by the  media on the lights and shadows of 
science and technology with regard to public policy issues. it is very important to stimulate 
continuing exchanges between scientists and the media.  
 
16. Science and technology  are the key to achieving sustainability and development simultaneously. 
For the benefit  of future generations,  we must maintain  and strengthen invest ment  in science  and 
technology  despite unfavorable global economic and fiscal conditions .  
 
17. To solve the serious problems of humankind, science and technology will not be sufficient without 
significant changes in individual and social behavior to promote much more effi cient use of 
materials and energy. Public education will be needed to change the prevalent mindset about such 
issues.  
 
18. The STS forum  has grown to be a movement for global leaders in various fields . We look forward 
to meeting here again to contribute to building a better future for humankind.  We agreed to hold 
the 8th Annual Meeting of the STS forum  in Kyoto from October 2 to 4, 2011.

STATEMENT  
 
 
1. The 8th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum took place from October  2 to 4, 
with the participation of 800 global leaders in science and technology, policy, business and media from 
approximately 80 countries, regions and international organizations . 
 
2. The March 11 earthquake, tsunami and the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station accident caused severe 
shocks to Ja pan. The entire world admired the poise, resilience and dignity with which the people of 
Japan confronted these disasters. The Fukushima accident has focused attention on the question of how 
to deal with nuclear power for the future of humanity . We decided  to raise “Energy and Environment” and 
“Nuclear Safety and Future Development” to the top of the agenda of this year’s forum.  
 
3. Any future energy supply should include a wide range of options that adhere to the best standards of 
safety and environmental and  social compatibility and are available at competitive prices. Different 
countries may choose different paths to an energy -secure future. Nuclear energy will continue to play a 
significant role for the foreseeable future. Strengthening nuclear safety measu res is crucially important 
and addressing nuclear security is vital. We agreed that it is necessary to strengthen international 
cooperation on these issues.  
 
4. In the area of  global health problems , research into  genomic and regenerative medicine  has been 
developing very rapidly.  Under these conditions, research into personalized and preventive medicine 
should also be accelerated. capacity for dealing with infectious diseases as well as non -communicable 
diseases in developing countries must be strengthened. A  new international system is needed for better  
collaboration between industry, the public sector and the WHO.  
 
5. The aging of the population poses special challenges and opportunities, not just in providing geriatric care 
or social safety nets, but also in rethinking the social context of the participation of the elderly as 
productive citizens. Science and technology have crucial roles to play in improving the quality of later life.  
 
6. More than half the world ’s population is already living in cities, and urba nization is growing rapidly, which 
raises  a variety of  challenges and opportunities . We must promote more livable and humane urban 
environments with efficient “ smart cities” using science and technology and urban planning, and involving 
the citizens themse lves. 
 
7. To feed a world of 9 -10 billion people and abolish the hunger that blights our earth, we need to promote 
better agriculture to deal with growing populations, changing diets and maintaining the environment. R&D 
is needed for more nutritious and more resilient crops, better farming systems, ecosystem management 
and reduction of wastage. Agricultural biotechnology, including genetically modified organisms, should 
contribute to these improvements. Balanced nutrition, especially for mothers and newborns, enhances 
health and reduces mortality.  
 
8. Unlike the oceans, there is some global attention, albeit insufficient, being given to fresh water and forest 
conservation issues. We therefore proposed establishing an international body to champion ocean issues 
and to frame and focus ocean policies. This body is expected to collaborate with the prominent ocean 
science and policy communities to expedite knowledge translation and exchange to advance ocean 
policies globally.   2 
 9. Creating an effective ICT infrastructure  is critical for reducing disparities  among and within nations in 
access to education, healthcare  and business  opportunities . In a rapidly changing information and 
communication technology environment, rethinking cybersecurity  and privacy has become  crucially  
important for the future  of ICT. 
 
10. Nanotechnology will play  a vitally important role in various fields including electronics , medicine, life 
science and materials. We should make positive use of nanotechnology  as a potential technology to 
explore new front iers. 
  
11. Collaboration among academia, industry and government is essential for maintaining economic and 
social vitality. Universities and research institutions should provide basic research and advanced results 
of R&D to stimulate innovation, as well as sc ience and engineering education. Universities are the hub 
that links the humanities and science, promoting critical thinking and preparing students to be responsible 
global citizens.  
 
12. The Academ ies of Engineering Presidents met at the STS forum  at the first time this year. The 
Academies of Engineering are expected to strengthen the bridges between science and technology and 
society.  
 
13. We reaffirmed the need to  promote science diplomacy to enhance relations between science 
communities across national boundar ies, thereby creating new avenues of dialogue and understanding 
between nations.   
 
14. Funding agencies should finance international science collaboration  programs promoting multilateral 
arrangements, especially on global issues . Supporting education, research and local entrepreneurship is 
essential for capacity -building in developing countries.  
 
15. The adjunct session on Regional Climate Change  reviewed best practices of how knowledge action 
networks mobilized science, community and decision -makers to take local  actions . Such knowledge 
action networks should be organized in all places threatened by the negative impacts of climate change.  
 
16. We noted the importance of objective scientific evidence -based reporting by the media  as well as better 
communication by scientists and their institutions in dealing with  the lights and shadows of science and 
technology with regard to public policy issues. it is vital to stimulate continuing dialogues  between 
scientists and the media.  
 
17. To solve the serious problems of humankind, science and technology will not be sufficient without 
significant changes in individual and social behavior . The social sciences, humanities and social 
innovations have an important role to play in this area. Public education will be needed to promote 
awar eness about the need for more efficient use of finite resources.  
 
18. Humanity’s continued existence and prosperity on this globe depend on sustainability. This means living 
in harmony with nature and is of the utmost importance for humankind.  We will therefo re continue to 
focus on sustainability  as a major  theme  of the STS forum . 
 
19. The value of the STS -sponsored ongoing exchange of views on science and technology issues among 
various stakeholders and global leaders has made it clear that the STS forum  has deve loped from simply 
a conference into  a movement .  
 
20. We look forward to meeting here again to contribute to building a better future for humankind.  We agreed 
to hold the 9 th Annual Meeting of the STS forum  in Kyoto from  Sunday, October 7 to Tuesday, October 9 , 
2012.

with the participation of about  1,000 global leaders in science  and technology, policy, business and 
media from 96 countries, regions and international organizations who met to reflect on how to expand 
the “lights” and control the “shadows” of science and technolog y, and promote innovation for solving 
our shared challenges. 
 
2. Science, technology and innovation will be needed to counter gl obal environmental threats and 
promote growth and prosperity. the necessary investments should  be made in these, despite current 
difficult economic and social conditions.  
 
3. Any future energy supply should include a wide range of options  that adhere to the best standards of 
safety and environmental and social compatibility, and life cycle cost assessment. Different countries 
may choose different paths to an energy-secure and sustainable future. Nuclear energy will continue to 
play a significant role in many countries for the foreseeable future. The Fukushima accident taught us 
the crucial importance of nuclear safety. Strengthening nuclear  security and non-proliferation are also 
vital.   
4. In the area of global health problems, research into genomic and regenerative medicine has developed 
very rapidly. Under these conditions, research into personalized and preventive medicine should also 
be accelerated. Medical programs for dealing with infectious and non-communicable diseases, and in 
particular developing antibiotics for drug-resistant microbes, must be strengthened . A new international 
system is needed for better collaboration among industry, acade mia, the public sector and WHO, with 
special attention to strengthening capacity in developing count ries.  
 
5. ICT is a highly effective tool for reducing disparities among and within nations in access to education, 
healthcare and business opportunities and is a key enabler of innovation and productivity enhancement. 
In a rapidly changing ICT environment, transformative in ways that cannot be foreseen, international 
cooperation in cyberse curity and privacy measures have become crucially important. 
 
6. Nanotechnology will play a vitally important role in various fields including electronics, photonics, 
energy, water, medicine, life science and materials. Nanotechno logy is a key technology for innovation

9. In light of the global development of corporate business and ac ademic research activities, intellectual 
property systems should be improved as a basic international in frastructure. International 
harmonization should be accelerated to stimulate innovation and  economic development. 
 
10. Presidents of 16 research organizations met at the STS forum  for the first time this year and had very 
productive exchanges of views. We welcome that this meeting will be held again next year and expect 
further cooperation among these organizations to be accelerated .  
 
11. Science and technology diplomacy enhances relations across nati onal boundaries. Supporting 
education, research and local entrepreneurship is essential for  capacity-building in developing 
countries. Funding agencies should finance international science collaboration programs promoting 
multilateral arrangements, especially on global issues. 
 
12. The adjunct session on Regional Climate Change reviewed best practices in promoting adaptation to 
regional climate change: for example, how coastal cities and re gions are preparing for sea level rise. 
Knowledge Action Networks are proving to be an effective tool in local adaptation.  
 
13. Science and technology brings changes, and the public can make informed decisions, provided that the 
risks and benefits are clearly explained. Therefore, exchanges between scientists and society should 
be broadened and improved. High-qu ality science programs should  be developed to interest and inform 
the public about science. 
 
14. To solve the serious problems of humankind, science and technology alone will not be sufficient without 
significant changes in individual and social behavior. The social sciences, humanities and social 
innovations have an important role to play in this area. Public  education will be needed to promote 
awareness about the need for mo re efficient use of finite resou rces. 
 
15. The aging of the population poses special challenges and opport unities, not just in providing geriatric 
care or social safety nets, but a lso in rethinking the social context of the participation of the elderly as 
productive citizens. Science and technology have a crucial role  to play in improving the quality of later 
life. 
 16. More than half the world’s population is already living in citi es, and urbanization is growing rapidly, 
which raises a variety of challenges and opportunities. We must  promote more livable and humane 
urban environments with efficient, sustainable “smart cities” u sing science and technology and urban 
planning, and involve the citizens themselves. 
 
17. The world’s population continues to expand and the earth is fin ite. We need to think of humanity’s 
condition, not just in twenty or  thirty years’ time, but over a  longer-term perspective . In this respect, the 
environment, energy, food and water are critical sustainability  issues. This means that living in harmony 
with nature is of the utmost imp ortance for humankind. We will therefore continue to focus on 
sustainability. 
 
18. We look forward to meeting here again to contribute to building  a better future for humankind. We 
agreed to hold the 10
th Annual Meeting of the STS forum  in Kyoto from Sunday, October 6 to Tuesday,

 Science and Technology in Society (STS) forum 
10th Annual Meeting  
October 8, 2013 , Kyoto, Japan  
STATEMENT  
 
1. The 10 th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum  took place from October  6 to 8, with 
the participation of  about 1,100 global leaders in science and technology, policy, business and media from 
approximately 100  countries, regions and international organizations who met to reflect on how to  expand the 
“lights ” and control the “ shadows ” of science and technology, and to discuss the  two major themes of 
innovation and sustainability . 
 
2. Any future energy supply should include a wide range of options that adhere to the best standards of safety and 
environmental and social compatibility. Different countries may choose different paths to an energy -secure and 
sustainable future. In light of the Fukushima accident, global discussion on the use of nuclear power and  the 
crucial importance  of operational  safety has become more active. Over the long term, continued burning of 
fossil fuels will ex act an unacceptable environmental cost. We will need different energy sources, and nuclear 
power will remain an important option. Intensive enhancement of nuclear security and non -proliferation are also 
vital.  
 
3. In the area of  global health problems , resea rch into  genomic and regenerative medicine  has developed very 
rapidly. iPS cells are providing a potentially breakthrough technology  for cures, and research into personalized 
and preemptive medicine should also be accelerated. Promoting brain medical science research is important 
for improving quality of life, especially among aging populations.  There is more need than ever for a  new 
international system to improve collaboration among  industry, academia, the public sector and WHO.   
 
4. While ICT is having a ma jor impact on economic activity, medicine, education and business, international  
cooperation is needed to create global rules for ICT, including  cybersecurity  and privacy measures.  
 
5. Nanotechnology and new materials are playing a vitally important role in v arious fields including economic 
growth, healthcare and urban living . These are  key technolog ies for innovation and new fields of application.  
 
6. We need  to strengthen our capacity to defend against and cope with disasters through science, research, 
monitoring and early  warning systems, infrastructure  modifications and land -use planning  in keeping with 
hazard maps .  
 
7. Collaboration among  academia, industry and government is essential for society to ensure a sustainable global 
community.  This collaboration,  involving the public and the private, including international activities, should be 
promoted and be inclusive . Innovation and entrepreneurship are important in advanced and developing 
countries, especially with support for the empowerment of women. We  expect academies of science, 
engineering and medicine, as well as universities,  to play an important role  in this collaboration. One role of 
Chief Technology Officers is to serve as a bridge between science , technology  and business.  
 
8. In light of the global develo pment of corporate business and academic research activities, intellectual property 
systems should be improved as a basic international infrastructure. International harmonization should be 
accelerated to stimulate innovation and economic development.  
 
9. Science and technology diplomacy enhances relations across national boundaries . Supporting education, 
research and local entrepreneurship is essential for capacity -building in developing countries.  Funding 
agencies should finance international science collabo ration  programs promoting multilateral arrangements, 
especially on global issues. We welcome the science and technology ministers’ Round Table and the peer 
meetings held by the presidents of universities, science and engineering academies, research institu tes or 
funding agencies at the STS forum  as complementary to official science and technology diplomacy.  
 2 
 10. The adjunct session on Regional Action on Climate Change (RACC5)  reviewed best practices in promoting 
adaptation to regional climate change: for exampl e, how coastal cities and regions are preparing for sea level 
rise. Knowledge Action Networks are proving to be an effective tool in local adaptation.  
 
11. To solve the serious problems of humankind, science and technology alone will not be sufficient without  an 
increase in trust and significant changes in individual and social behavior . Therefore , education programs 
should involve sustainability concepts  throughout the educational system,  and exchanges between scientists 
and society should be broadened and im proved  so that the public can make informed decisions, provided that 
the risks and benefits of science and technology are clearly explained. In addition, the importance of science 
and engineering education should be highlighted and high-quality science programs should be developed to 
interest and inform the public about science.  The arts, humanities, social sciences and social innovations have 
an important role to play in this area.  
 
12. More than half the world’s population is already living in cities, and ur banization is growing rapidly, which raises 
a variety of challenges and opportunities. We must promote more livable and humane urban environments with 
efficient, sustainable “smart cities” using science and technology and urban planning, supporting the evo lution 
of the cities, peoples, values and culture.  
 
13. The oceans  and seas are a major and essential part of the earth’s environment, with significant  impacts  on 
climate and food , and are being affected by human activity . Neither policymakers nor the public know enough 
about the oceans. Both research and dissemination for awareness need to be greatly reinforced.  
 
14. The world’s population continues to expand  and the earth is finite . We need to think of humanity ’s condition,  not 
just in twenty or thirty  years ’ time, but  over a longer -term perspective. In this respect, the environment, energy, 
food and water are critical sustainability issues. Living in harmony with nature  is of the utmost importance for 
humankind and we will therefore continue to focus on sustainability. 
 
15. The STS forum welcomes the statement of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking at the opening 
plenary session , announcing a Japanese government initiative, the Global Energy and Environment Innovation 
Forum (GEEIF), to be held for the first time next year in Tokyo immediately following the STS forum .  
 
16. The STS forum , marking its 10th anniversary this year, has evolved from a mere conference into a movement 
for global leaders. We will build on the network we have established to further address the problems facing 
humanity and seek solutions. We look forward to meeting here again to contribute to building a better future for 
humankind.  We agreed to hold the 11th Annual Meeting of the STS forum  in Kyoto from  Sunday, October 5 to 
Tuesday, October 7, 2014. We commit to activities to pave the way for future generations.

 Science and Technology in Society (STS) forum 
11th Annual Meeting 
Kyoto, Japan, October 7, 2014 
STATEMENT 
 
1. The 11th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Societ y forum took place from October 5 to 7, with 
the participation of about 1, 000 global leaders in science and technology, policy, business and media from 
approximately 100 countries, regions and international organiza tions who met to reflect on how to strengthen 
the “lights” and control the “shadows” of science and technolog y.  
 
2. We are highly honored that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has attended the forum four times, has 
now accepted to serve as honorary chairman of this forum. His leadership, based on profound insights into 
humanity’s future and the role of science and technology in soc iety, will contribute greatly to our forum 
achieving its goals.  
 
3. The STS forum has entered its second decade. It is with satisfa ction that we see that the forum has grown 
from a mere conference into one of the most important movements  for global leaders, and we will build on and 
broaden the network we have established to further address the problems facing humanity and seek solutions. 
As part of our mandate, at this year’s meeting the forum fully instituted an “STS Young Leaders Program” 
inviting more active participation of younger leaders. We will also hold workshops in major cities of the world, 
including Beijing, Berlin and Kuala Lumpur, before the next Ann ual Meeting, to expand the forum’s activities. 
 
4. The STS Forum will thus be reaching out to expand the communiti es with which it is involved. The quest for a 
sustainable future for humankind will require greater collabora tion between science and society, to increase 
public trust and promote significant changes in individual and social behavior. Exchanges between scientists 
and society should be broadened and improved so that the public  can make informed decisions, provided that 
the risks and benefits are clearly explained. In addition, the importance of STEM education should be 
highlighted and high-quality science programs should be developed to interest and inform the public about the 
role of science and technology in society. The arts, humanities , social and political sciences and social 
innovations are also key elements.  
 
5. Out of that intensified interaction, we strive to develop a coa lition that includes the public and private sectors, 
academia, government and industry as well as the civil society.  This coalition will help develop inclusive 
frameworks that cover the entire global community, frameworks that will expand the role of women and give 
greater voice to academies of science, engineering and medicine . Chief Technology Officers will become 
bridges between business and the developers of science and technology in universities, private labs and the 
public sphere, to nurture innovation. 
 
6. Industrial innovation driven by new manufacturing technologies,  robotics, nanotechnology and new materials 
is playing a vital role in various areas including product deve lopment, healthcare and urban living. Agricultural 
innovation will also be needed as climate change will challenge  the production patterns in many parts of the 
world and aridity makes itself felt in larger geographic zones.   
 
7. It will be necessary to link the innovations in one part of the  world to others that need them, thereby ensuring 
that sustainable solutions spread throughout the planet and tha texpanding populations, especially in the 
poorest countries, find the means for decent living standards by husbanding resources and working with new 
plant varieties of more drought tolerant and salinity resistant  plants to ensure food security despite the vast 
and expanding aridity that will be spreading in large parts of the globe.  
 
8. Science and technology diplomacy enhances relations across nati onal boundaries. Supporting education, 
research and local entrepreneurship is essential for capacity-b uilding in developing countries. Funding 
agencies should finance international science collaboration programs promoting multilateral arrangements, 
especially on global issues. Competition and cooperation among industries focusing on science and 
technology in the global economy today are increasingly importa nt. Embargo until 12:30 STS forum  (Non-Profit Organization) 
 
 
  
9. Global environmental problems are reaching a critical stage. The need for a consensus on specific measures 
to reduce CO 2 emissions is urgent. The adjunct session on Regional Action on  Climate Change (RACC6) 
reviewed best practices to promote resilience, and to explore mechanisms that would enhance the incentives 
for communities and institutions to build up their resilience a head of the likely severe weather phenomena 
which different parts of the world will witness; and encouraged  initiatives through Knowledge Action Networks, 
for example, to prepare coastal cities and regions for sea level rise. RACC6 will cooperate closely with “Future 
Earth,” a new 10-year international research initiative begun in 2013, and will organize a workshop in 
Alexandria before next year’s meeting. 
 
10. The environment we live in and the ecosystem we are part of are  not just the land mass we inhabit and the 
atmosphere that envelops us. By far the greatest part of our planet is covered by water: the oceans and the 
glaciers and the surface waters that replenish the moisture in the earth, in a hydrological cycle that allows life 
to exist. The oceans and their deep currents are central to the  climate and the management of GHG 
emissions and the improved understanding of the oceans and the fresh waters of the earth are at the core of 
developing effective sustainable development futures for humans , with adequate energy, good health and a 
rich social life. 
 
11. The shale gas and oil revolution has opened a new phase in the world’s energy supply. We must recognize 
that any future energy supply should include a wide range of options that adhere to the best standards of 
safety and environmental and social compatibility. Over the long term, continued burning of fossil fuels will 
exact an unacceptable environmental cost. We will need diverse energy sources, and nuclear power will 
remain an important option. Intensive enhancement of nuclear sa fety, security and non-proliferation are also 
vital. 
 
12. In the area of global health issues, research into genomic and regenerative medicine has developed very 
rapidly. iPS cells have high potential to generate breakthrough  technology for cures, and research into 
personalized and preemptive medicine should also be accelerated  together with scientific knowledge on 
nutrition. Promoting brain science research will contribute to improving quality of life, especially among aging 
populations. There is more need than ever for a new international system to improve collaboration among 
industry, academia, the public sector and WHO for global health . It is also urgent to strengthen the global 
community’s capacity for dealing with infectious diseases, incl uding Ebola hemorrhagic fever.  
 
13. ICT, especially with the emergence of “Big Data,” is changing everything, from research to production, from 
education to entertainment, from discussion to discovery. A global-level consensus on universal ICT rules is 
needed, with particular emphasis on security and privacy. The merging of the internet with mobile telephony 
will transform society and also assist the increased empowerment of women, in advanced and developing 
countries alike, by encouraging more female participation in re search and development, education and 
entrepreneurship. 
 
14. More than half the world’s population is already living in citi es; rapidly growing urbaniza tion raises a variety of 
challenges and opportunities. More livable, humane and safer ur ban environments must be developed using 
science and technology for urban planning to create “smart citi es,” to support the evolution of cities, peoples, 
values and cultures. 
 
15. The world’s population should not continue to expand indefinitely, as the earth is finite. We need to think of 
humanity’s condition from the perspective of 100 or 500 years from now and promote global cooperation on 
the management of resources and waste. In this respect, living in harmony with nature is of the utmost 
importance and we will therefore continue to focus on sustainability for humankind and our planet. We are all 
committed to activities to pave the way for future generations.  
 
16. We look forward to meeting here again next year. We agreed to hold the 12th Annual Meeting of the STS 
forum in Kyoto from Sunday, Oct ober 4 to Tuesday, October 6, 20 15.  "

 Science and Technology in Society forum  (STS  forum ) 
12th Annual Meeting  
Kyoto, Japan, October 6, 2015  
STATEMENT  
 
 
1. The 12th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum took place from 
October 4 to 6, with the participation of over 1,000 gl obal leaders in science and technology, 
policy, business and media from nearly 100 countries, regions and international organizations.  
 
2. At the meeting, based on the recognition that the earth is becoming finite for the activities of 
humankind in the 21st century, participants reflected on how to strengthen the “lights” and 
control the “shadows” of science and technology. We considered the future of humanity and the 
sustainable development of society over a longer -term perspective, thinking of what the futu re 
will be like not just in twenty or thirty years’ time, but over 100 or 500 years from now.  
 
3. Based on discussions at this year’s meeting, we would like to highlight the following viewpoints.  
 
A. Energy and Environment  
 Over the long term, continued burning of fossil fuels will exact an unacceptable 
environmental cost and exhaust finite resources. We should have diverse energy sources for 
ensuring reliable and stable supply, and nuclear power should remain an important option, 
under the conditions of safety, security and non -proliferation.  
 We also stressed the need to establish an international framework for effectively mitigating 
greenhouse gas emissions that includes all countries. We hope that our message will be 
reflected in the discussions at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in 
December 2015 in Paris.  
 
B. Innovation  
   Industrial innovation driven by new manufacturing technologies, robotics, nanotechnology 
and new materials is playing a vital role in various areas including product  development, 
healthcare and urban living.  
   We should strive to develop a coalition that includes the public and private sectors, 
academia, government and industry. Chief Technology Officers should become bridges 
between business and academia in the development of science and technology to nurture 
innovation. The ultimate source of major innovation is basic science, which has to be supported 
in both the public and private sectors.  
 
C. ICT and Smart Cities  
   A global -level consensus on universal ICT rules is needed, as advanced utilization of ICT 
with improved security and privacy protection becomes essential for future human development. 
The merging of the internet with mobile telephony and other devices is transforming society and 
is helping developing countries and empowering women. The “Internet of Things” and use of 
“Big Data,” as well as the emergence of AI and robotics, will also create new challenges and 
opportunities for society.  
   More livable, humane, disaster -resilient and energy -efficient urb an environments must be 
developed using science and technology. ICT in particular, through urban planning and better 
management systems, can help create “smart cities,” to support the evolution of cities, peoples, 
values and cultures.                              STS forum  (NPO) 
 
 
  
D. Global Health  
   Recently, research into iPS cells and genomics has been achieving breakthrough results in 
life sciences. By making these results fit for practical use, we should encourage further progress 
in personalized and preemptive medicine, in harmony with human heal th, safety and ethical 
issues. Scientific knowledge on nutrition should also be expanded for human welfare.  
   A new international system is required to improve collaboration among developed and 
developing countries and WHO for global health, especially for dealing with infectious disease 
pandemics.  
 
E. Resource Conservation  
   The oceans and their deep currents are central to the climate and the management of 
greenhouse gas emissions. Better understanding of the oceans and the fresh waters of the 
earth is  vital for developing effective sustainable development futures for humans. We must 
think of better ways to make efficient use of various kinds of resources with careful attention to 
prevent significant problems for society.  
   To produce the food necessa ry for humanity in the face of the increasing uncertainties of 
climate change will require better use of land and water and more adapted resilient crops 
deploying the best science, including the use of GMOs, which have been shown to be safe and 
can contrib ute much to improve the nutritious content of the food of the poor.  
 
F. Cooperation in Science and Technology  
   The innovations in one part of the world should be linked to others that need them, thereby 
ensuring that sustainable solutions spread througho ut the planet.  
   Supporting education, research and local entrepreneurship is essential for capacity -building 
in developing countries. Cooperation among industries focusing on science and technology in 
the global economy today is increasingly important, while global competition among industries is 
the key to encouraging innovation.  
 
G. Science, Technology and Education  
   Exchanges between scientists and society should be broadened and improved so that the 
public can make informed decisions, provided that  the risks and benefits are clearly explained.  
   The importance of STEM education should be highlighted. High -quality science programs 
should be developed to interest and inform the public about the role of science and technology 
in society. Emphasis on the education and empowerment of women would help enhance 
sustainable development.  
 
4. This year, we held workshops in major cities Kuala Lumpur and Milan. We have also 
established an “STS forum Future Leaders’ Program” involving close to 80 active younger 
leaders for sustainable development of the forum. We will build on and expand the network we 
have established to further address the opportunities and challenges facing humanity.  
 
5. We look forward to meeting here again next year. We agreed to hold the 13th A nnual Meeting of 
the STS forum in Kyoto from Sunday, October 2 to Tuesday, October 4, 201 6.  
 

 
 "
2016," 
Science and Technology in Society (STS) forum 13th Annual Meeting  
Kyoto, Japan, October 4, 2016  
STATEMENT  
 
1.  The 13th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum took place 
from October 2 to 4, with the participation of nearly 1,200 global leaders in science and 
technology, policy -making, business, and media from nearly 100 countries, regions, and 
international organizations.  
 
2.     In 2015 , the world  adopted three major agreements: the Sendai Framework for 
Disaster Risk Reduction , the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to promote a 
balanced growth that leaves no one behind; and the Paris accords to limit the emissions of 
greenhouse gases .  In that context, our STS meetings here in Kyoto and the events that we 
organize elsewhere in the world, must focus on ensuring that the good intentions in these 
agreements are implemented.  
 
Energy, the Environment and Resources  
 
3. For the targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement to be met, all countries must  strive to 
create sustainable socioeconomic systems while balancing energy needs and care for the 
environment. More emphasis needs to  be placed on finding scientific and technological 
solutions to achieve a low -carbon society.   While new and renewable  energies will be an 
essential part of the solution, nuclear energy as a low -carbon energy source should also 
remain an important option  under the conditions of  safety, security and non -proliferation.  
 
Life Sciences and Global Health  
 
4. The rapid transformation of the life sciences opens very promising avenues of 
therapeutic treatment.  But these technologies also raise some ethical concerns especially 
with potential impacts on germline or hereditary changes. Further progress in personalized 
and preemptive medicine should be encouraged, with due attention given to safety and ethical 
issues.  
 
5.  The rapid development of diagnostics, v accines, and therapeutics to combat emerging 
infectious diseases presents scientific, manufacturing, and regulatory challenges. Novel 
approaches are needed for developing a response to the emergence of antibiotic resistant 
strains of bacteria that will bring back lethal diseases of the past, and which threaten literally 
millions of people worldwide. A new international system is required to improve regional and 
international collaboration led by the WHO.  
 
ICT and Smart Cities  
 
6. As it connects the world, ICT is also drastically changing economic activity and our 
lives, and thus a global -level consensus is needed on universal ICT rules for improved 
security and privacy. Personalized hand -held devices and access to the “cloud” are making 
possible innovative new services that can serve the needs of populations in developing 
countries, especially including women. The “Internet of Things” and use of “Big Data,” as 
well as the emergence of “AI” and “robotics,” will create new opportuniti es for society, but 
they raise challenges in our understanding of the social benefits and disruptions that machines bring. More active use of ICT in urban planning and management would make human 
habitats in the new smart cities more livable, humane, disas ter-resilient, and energy-efficient.   
 
7. Increasingly, we need to reflect on the relationships between people and the virtual 
world of ICT.  We must think about how ICT will impact on social solidarity and the sense of 
responsible citizenship that we ass ume are the pillars for creating an inclusive and sustainable 
society, a society concerned with the future of employment and retirement, as well as 
inequality and poverty, and intergenerational connections and equity.  
 
 
Population and Food  
 
8. Beyond energy, we must provide more food for a growing global population, who  
will also demand more balanced diets.  Producing food under changing climate conditions 
will require mo bilization of science and technology to better manage the available land and 
water sustainabl y, while we deploy the best science, including GMOs, to develop new plant 
varieties with greater drought and salt tolerance and shorter growing seasons.   
 
Science, Technology and Education  
 
9. Scientists should give the public  correct information on all topics from climate change 
to GMOs, so that they  can better understand the issues and compare benefits and risks, and 
support innovative and potentially useful applications of science and technology.  
 
10. STEM education should be emphasized and high -quality science programs developed 
to interest and inform the public about the role of science and technology in society, and how 
it helps with sustainability.  Emphasis on fostering younger generations and empowering 
women in all so cieties would bring forth their talent and would also help enhance sustainable 
development.  
 
Cooperation in Science and Technology  
 
11. Nurturing Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) requires collaboration between 
academia and business in addition to the central role of government in funding basic research 
and providing the regulatory framework within which the private sector brings forth new 
products, services and business models.  
 
12. International  cooperation between the scientific communities of the various countries 
is essential.  Collaborative efforts through open innovation should be continued while at the 
same time, issues related to intellectual property and technology transfer are addressed.  
 
13. This year, the STS forum held workshops in major cities Brussels, Delhi, Bangkok, 
and Nairobi. We have also established an “STS forum Young  Leaders Program” involving 
more than 100 active young leaders. We will build on and expand the network we have 
estab lished to further address the opportunities and challenges facing humanity.  
 
14. We look forward to meeting here again next year. We agreed to hold the 14th Annual 
Meeting of the STS forum in Kyoto from Sunday, October 1 to Tuesday, October 3, 2017.  "
2017," 
 Science and Technology in Society forum  (STS  forum ) 
14th Annual Meeting 
Kyoto, Japan, October 3, 2017   
STATEMENT 
 1. The 14
th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum  took place from 
October 1 to 3, with the parti cipation of nearly 1,400 global leaders in science and technology, 
policy-making, business, and media from nea rly 80 countries, regions, and international 
organizations.  
 2. In 2017, the STS forum  launched a new initiative to in crease the participation of business 
leaders and we included a special CEO (Chief Executive Officers) lunch meeting in our Annual 
Meeting program. Nineteen CEOs fr om prominent global companies attended. We also had a 
CTO (Chief Technology Office r) Meeting, which gathered close to 40 CTOs and heads of 
research, as well as a special lunch for heads of Foundations.   3. The Future Leaders Program, introduced in 2015, has further expanded, with close to 140 
young leaders under age 40 from bus iness and academic instituti ons, who had a special dialogue 
with most of the 15 Nobel Laur eates present at the Annual Meeting. This occasion was 
particularly well received by both the future leaders and the Nobel Laureates.  
 4. The STS forum  also held workshops in Delhi, Brussels , and Bali, Indonesia. We will continue to 
build on and expand the network we have establis hed to further address the opportunities and 
challenges facing humanity from  the long-term viewpoint.   
 5. During the STS 14
th Annual Meeting, the following points were highlighted.  
 Energy, Resources and Environment 6. Achieving a sustainable low-carbon society was recognized to be an objective not just in the 
developed world but also worldwide, particularly in the fast-developing economies. Science and 
technology is key to attaining this goal but social and economic solutions are also needed. Climate change mitigation is essential for sustainable development in harmony with nature. The 
interconnected issues of food, water, and energy  must be solved through science and technology, 
but energy policy must also be a component which can contribute to addressing this agenda. In 
this context, renewable energy plays a more impor tant role in the best mix of energy, although 
nuclear energy as a low-carbon energy source should also remain an important option under strict 
conditions of safety, security, and non-proliferation.  7. Beyond mitigation, there must  be adaptation and increased resilience in societies that will suffer 
from the impact of climate change and extreme events. We need to enhance the collection, 
storage, analysis, and deployment of scientific knowledge on space, earth, oceans, and water in 
order to devise appropriate policies and program s, nationally and locally. Knowledge from the 
humanities and social sciences combined with the natural sciences and making the best use of 
ICT should be deployed to make human society more  resilient to the damage brought by disasters 
and extreme environmental changes.  8. While the world’s population is expected to in crease before peaking at a high level, this globe’s 
resources are finite. World leader s, whether in government or indus try, should consider changes 
in population and its regional distribution to deploy  energy and food reflecting this appropriately. 
Food production under difficult conditions will require the application of the best of science–
including GMOs–to produce more food more effici ently. With urbanization accelerating, smart 
cities and sustainable human settlements with sm aller environmental impact and better quality of 
life for citizens are needed. These environments can be created by carefully designing systems,  
 deploying new materials and new technologies, and ma king better use of innovations in mobility 
and energy systems.    Life Sciences and Health Care 9. Progress in genome engineering and advanced medicine has the potential to improve human 
health. The accomplishments of R&D in the life scienc es should be available for the benefit of all 
of humanity, subject to certain ethical guidelines . Environmental factors such as Climate Change 
and air pollution as well as unhealthy diets, habi ts and lifestyles negatively impact health, and 
should be confronted by sust ained public education. At the same time, the fight against infectious 
disease is a global mission. We must build an international system to deliver health care to all 
parts of the world with the cooperation of WHO and other organizations. 
 10. Healthy aging is becoming a key issue for our so cieties. In addition to the use of personalized 
and preemptive medicine, creating more comfortable surroundings for the aged can contribute to 
healthy aging.  Digitized Society 11. The Internet of Things, Big Data, and AI , combined with robotics and autonomous systems, 
will not only radically transform our lives but also change the production process and the nature of 
economic activity. The impact of this on employm ent must be taken into  account. The benefits of 
progress in these ICT-related fields should enable people in developing countries to start new 
businesses with minimal resources. But the deploy ment of these new technologies challenges 
many aspects of privacy and security. New approaches are needed to alleviate the new and 
emerging risks of ICT.   Research and Innovation  12. STEM education in schools, as well as for the public at large, is essential for nurturing 
innovation and promoting sustain able development. Special efforts must be deployed to nurture 
the next generation of scientists. Policy-ma king and business decisions based on a sound 
knowledge of science and technology are of more significance than ever. High-quality science 
programs are needed to interest and inform the publ ic about the current status and the emerging 
issues of science and technology.   13. University-based research, both curiosity- driven and applied, and education, with government 
support and the involvement of private businesses, should play an important role in developing 
nodes for promoting innovation in society. Government, academia, and business must work 
together for growth and sustainable development in the global econom y as well as at the national 
level.  Cooperation in Science and Technology 14. Enhancing open innovation requires collaboration betwe en academia, business, and 
government. In that co ntext, mobility of researchers and engineers between conventional sectors 
(academia, industry, and government) as well as across countries is essential.   15. There are many aspects to internati onal cooperation in science and technology.  
Cooperation between different scientific communities in various co untries, or in some areas, can 
allow large-scale research, and cooperation be tween developed and developing countries is 
essential for development. Science diplomacy shoul d include the active participation of not only 
diplomats but also researcher s, engineers, and business leaders, to produce beneficial 
cross-border solutions.  16. We look forward to meeting here again next year. We agreed to hold the 15
th Annual Meeting 
of the STS forum  in Kyoto from Sunday, October 7 to Tuesday, October 9, 2018. "
2018," 
 Science and Technology in Society forum  (STS  forum ) 
15th Annual Meeting  
Kyoto, Japan, October 9, 201 8 
STATEMENT  
 
 
1. The 15th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum  took place from October 
7 to 9, with the participation of more than 1,400 global leaders in science and technology, policy -
making, business, and media from nearly 80 countries, regions, and international organizations.  
 2. Science and technology issues concern all of us, and they should not be left only to science and 
technology professionals. We must all think of them as our own problem. Open science 
encourages the broader participation of other scientists as well as citizens, reinforcing the idea of open societies. The problems also cannot be solved by one or two countries alone, and therefore 
it is impor tant for scientists, policy makers, business executives, and other leaders to gather and 
discuss the issues.  Beyond  that, effective communication of science and research findings to the 
public, thereby encouraging better understanding and greater participation of stakeholders  as 
science and technology continue to transform society.  
 
3. For the 15
th anniversary of the STS forum, we had a special plenary session on the “Lights and 
Shadows of Science and Technology ” reviewing the past 15 years to advance the discussion for 
the next 15 years . Even in this short span of time , the speed of innovation has been astounding, 
leading to exciting developments in science and technology. Our foundational concept of 
strengthening the lights and controlling the shadows remains unchanged, but we must now focus 
on new areas pioneered by scientific progress. The STS forum’s role in encouraging dialogue 
and actions on science and technology and the future of humanity is more important than ever.  
 
4. Based on discussion at the STS 15th Annual Meeting,  we would like to highlight the following 
points.   
 
Energy and Environment  
 
5. Lowering emissions remains a global priority. Harnessing existing and emerging scientific and 
technological knowledge for new energy  solutions will be essential to rapidly reach a Net Zero 
Emissions future.  Although global investment in renewable energy was on the decline last year , 
technical  innovations improved the efficient management of energy supply and demand. As we 
move toward the continued reduction of carbon in our economies , improving energy storage 
technologies will be key for the further development of electric vehicles and other innovations . 
While new sources of renewable energy are absolutely needed, nuclear energy remains a critical 
source for energy generation under strict conditions of safety, security , and non- proliferation.  
 
6. Despite prior efforts to mitigate climate change, some  nations are not achieving their Nationally 
Defined Contributions, leading to projections consistent with a 3 or 4 ℃ temperature increase  
rather than the 2℃ predicted.  In a drastically changing environment, we can expect even more 
extreme weather events and other hazards, including rising sea levels. We must  reinforce the 
global efforts to meet these global challenges. We should urgently enhance the collection, storage,  
analysis, and deployment of scientific knowledge on space, earth, and oceans to monitor the 
effects of our actions on the environment and to estimate the likely consequences. This should 
help us better design our programs for mitigating and adapting to cl imate change.   
 
Life Sciences and Healthcare  
 
7. Progress in  the new genetics  has opened new doors for  human gene- based therapy . Genetic 
science can also enhance food security when applied to plant cultivation and animal breeding. As 
we move in these  directions, it is essential that there be a broadly based societal discussion on 
the ethics and legal aspects that should govern the application of this  new technology  to humans.   
  
 8. While life expectancy is increasing worldwide, the incidence of age- related diseases is also 
increasing. The rapid development of science and technology in advanced and preventive 
medicine provides new opportunities to support healthy aging.  
 
9. The fight against infectious disease is still a global mission. We must continue to make an effort 
to build an international system to help nations deliver  good health care to all parts of the world 
with the cooperation of WHO and other organizations.  
 
Digital Society  
 
10. Robotics,  machine- human interaction,  Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things , and Big Data  
analytics  offer opportunities for changing production process es, the conduct of economic activity , 
and many other aspects of our lives . Other promising technologies include blockchains (subject 
to curbing their enormous energy consumption), quantum computing,  and novel applications for 
Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Global cooperation and joint projects  among governments, 
industries, and academia on standards  and security measures are needed even as we move 
towards more Open Science and even the promotion of co-creation with stakeholders and SMEs.  
At the same time, we need to manage job disruption  and protect society against the misuse of 
personal data.  Preserving  individual freedoms, respecting privacy , and guaranteeing a certain 
degree of anonymity must be the rule.  
 
Research and Innovation 
 
11. Education is going through a revolution, not just in terms of content but also in terms of teaching 
methods and the incorporation of ICT throughout basic schooling , university , and graduate studies , 
with its potential to provide much wider access to an excellent education around the globe.  The 
role of universities must include both the advancement of  science and technology as well as 
concern with the Ethical, Legal , and Social issues associated with these advances.  
 
12. Environmental concerns and sustainability should be the most important forces driving industrial 
innovation. The costs of pollution and excessive resource depletion should be factored into all of 
our economic strategies , and go vernments should create the frameworks that will induce 
economic actors to take these into account.   
 
13. The challenges for the food and agricultural industries with respect  to the international community 
are related to initiatives for improving food security through smart and integrated production.  
This includes  incorporating ICT and other leading- edge technologies , including  the breeding and 
engineering of plants to be more salinity and drought resistant with a shorter growing season and 
with greater resistance to suffering post-harvest losses . It is essential that each country make an 
effort, through policies, initiative s, and concrete strategies , to tackle technical problems in smart 
agriculture, to encourage high value urban agricul ture and hydroponics,  and to help develop a 
highly productive food industry under a sustainable development agenda.  
 
Cooperation in Science and Technology  
 
14. Science is increasingly moving toward an open framework for knowledge exchange, protected by 
appropriate intellectual property rights and increasingly encouraged by governments with policies 
for Science, Technology , and Innovation. The links between peoples will increasingly require that 
a greater role be given  to S&T diplomacy in a world where many tensions still exist and all could 
benefit from more harmonious scientific cooperation and exchanges.   
 
15. Although the challenges are great, human intelligence and innovation are up to the task of finding 
appropriate soluti ons.  It is essential that academia, governments , and industry promote a 
climate for innovation and the legal framework that will encourage the transformation of new ideas 
into viable  and sustainable enterprises that benefit society and the environment we all depend on.  
 
16. We look forward to meeting here again next year  and have agreed to hold the 16th Annual Meeting 
of the STS forum in Kyoto from Sunday, October 6 to Tuesday, October 8, 2019.  "
2019,"Science and Technology in Society forum  (STS forum ) 
16th Annual Meeting  
Kyoto, Japan, October 8, 2019  
STATEMENT  
 
1. The 16th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum  took place from October 6 
to 8, with the participation of more than 1,400  global leaders in science and technology, policymaking, 
business, and media from nearly 80 countries, regions, and international organizations.  
 
2. The world is experiencing some negative changes. Not only world trade and security but also 
international collaboration in science and technology are facing major challenges as the multilateral 
global system is being called into question . At the same time, we are increasingly called upon to 
address the negative aspects of prevailing technologies and lifestyles, ranging from climate change 
and biodiversity loss to cybersecurity challenges to plastic debris in the oceans in order to ensure 
sustainable development for humankind and our planet earth. In this context, the role of the STS forum , 
where not only scientists but also policymakers, business executives, and ot her leaders gather and 
discuss the “lights and shadows ” of science and technology as their own problems, continues to grow 
in importance and relevance.  
 
3. This year we highlighted “Energy and Environment, ” which directly affects our lives. We discussed 
optio ns for maintaining economic development, while controlling the shadows resulting from 
technological development. Other principal topics of our Annual Meeting included AI (artificial 
intelligence) and society, healthcare, financing of basic science, innovation, and international as well 
as academia, business, and government collaboration in science and technology.  
 
Energy and Environment  
4. The urgent necessity to address ever -increasing energy needs with minimum environmental impact 
requires transformative energy shifts from high - to low -carbon energy sources  at unprecedented 
speed . In this context, nuclear energy remains a critical source for stable large -volume electricity 
generation, under strict conditions of safety, security, and non -proliferation. Invest ments  must be made  
in advanced technologies for low -emission energy sources, reliable energy storage, massive 
electrification , and negative carbon emissions such as carbon capture and utilization. IT-based smart 
grids are essential for efficiently balancing sustainable  energy supply and demand with minimum 
damage to the environment.  
 
5. Climate change poses a threat to human lives, by causing extreme weather events such as hurricanes 
and forest fires, as well as extreme heat events. Erratic rainfall patterns cause floods, storms or 
droughts, which negatively affect water supply and agricultural production, impacting food security. 
We must continue to adapt to and mitigate climate change by utilizing scientific knowledge and data 
on Earth and the oceans collected through ocean monitoring and satellite observations. We also need 
to mobilize the tools of the biological and ICT revolutions to promote genetically modified plant 
breeding with desirable traits like salt and drought resistance and short growing season. This should 
be combined with precision farming, to increase efficiency of water use and minimize loss between 
farms and markets. Also, water and sanitation services should be available to all citizens.  
  
Life Sciences and Healthcare  
6. Rapid progress in life sciences has brought the promise of advanced and personalized medicine, such 
as gene therapy and regenerative medicine, along with the application of advanced analytics to biological data. That implies that discussion and guidelines on the ethics of applying these 
technologies to human beings must constantly be updated, especially as we seek new treatments for 
diseases for which current therapies are inadequate.  
 
7. Supporting healthy aging is a primary issue, to improve quality of life and reduce the cost of social 
security and the burden on younger generations. Research is needed to assess if lifestyle changes  
and preventive and personalized medicine are to play an important role in keeping older people healthy.  
 
8. Meanwhile, climate change brings the potential spread of infectious diseases through shifting climate 
zones. Sustained efforts are also needed to build an international system to help nations deliver good 
health care to all parts of the world, with the cooperation of WHO and other organizations.  
 
Information -Driven Society  
9. Through innovations such as robotics and machine -human interaction, AI, IoT (Internet of Things), 
and Big Data analytics , our societies are being changed at an unprecedented rate . While research 
and development  to make our lives more pleasant and comfortable, safer and even smarter should 
continue, efforts should be made to address concerns that the progress of AI -driven society is having 
a negative impact, including job loss, on human society. In an ICT -centric  society, cybersecurity is key 
to preserving individual freedom, respecting privacy, and guaranteeing a certain degree of anonymity. 
Social networking services must make stronger efforts to eradicate erroneous and inappropriate 
information from their platf orms.   
 
Basic Science and Innovation  
10. Basic research has led to ground -breaking discoveries that have resulted in breakthrough 
technologies and expanded human horizons. The most important innovations have resulted from new 
scientific knowledge. Appropriate  funding for basic curiosity -driven research is essential. Moving from 
scientific insight to usable technology requires collaboration among academia, government, and 
industry. Such collaboration is the basis for building a thriving innovation ecosystem, wh ere scientific 
discoveries are translated into practical applications and industrial innovations are generated under 
the appropriate legal framework, including respect for intellectual property rights.  
 
International Cooperation in Science and Technology  
11. It is important to promote international science cooperation and collaboration to strengthen science 
and enhance science diplomacy to build bridges  to developing nations .  
 
Society and Science and Technology  
12. Finally, if we are to effectively address climate change and the challenges that we face with growing 
populations and expanding economies, we must achieve considerable changes in our current energy 
mix and eliminate dependence on fossil fuels. Drastic action is needed that will require rapid political 
decision -making, new commercial strategies, and the development of new technologies. The STS 
forum  is intended to provide the opportunity for dialogue between the actors to develop a consensus 
on how we can ad dress the challenges of putting the world on a sustainable path for the future.  
 
13. We look forward to meeting here again next year and have agreed to hold the 17th Annual Meeting of 
the STS forum in Kyoto from Sunday, October 4 to Tuesday, October 6, 2020.

from October 3 to 6 live online from a base studio in Kyoto, with online participation of about 1,500 global leaders in science and technology, policymaking, business, and media from 
nearly 120 countries, regions, and international organizations. This meeting is taking place in 
one of the most challenging periods in history, when a pandemic is devastating the world, and 
the impacts of climate change require redoubling our efforts at limiting emissions and 
promoting adaptation and resilience if we are to adhere to a sustainable development path.  
  
COVID -19 Pandemic  
 
2. The COVID -19 pandemic that has forced this change in our format has already infected 
more than 35 million persons and claimed over a million lives . It has demonstrated the 
vulnerability of human societies, and underlined the global, regional , and local inequalities 
among our citizens. The pandemic is not just a public health crisis, an economic crisis, and a 
social crisis , but also more seriously, a crisis of confidenc e.   
 
3. The public health crisis has unleashed an economic crisis of unprecedented magnitude, 
as measures to combat the spread of the disease have impacted economic transactions within 
and between countries and affected economic growth and jobs. In many countries economic 
contraction and massive unemployment are the new reality. Entire sectors like travel and hospitality are devastated. Supply chains have been disrupted.  Patterns of work have been 
transformed, with many of those who can do so working from  home. Education is facing radical 
challenges as distance learning supplements, if not replaces, face- to-face instruction. The 
social and economic impact is enormous and we are facing an uncertain future. The future will depend on science . Young people must not only take up the torch of science , technology, and 
innovation, but society must  also have greater confidence in science. Trust must be rebuilt. 
This in turn requires more transparency in science and greater, inclusive,  multi- faceted public 
dialogue that rejects disinformation and efforts to politically pressure scientists and censor 
scientific reports.  
 
4. The pandemic has struck countries around the globe unevenly, and success in coping 
with COVID -19 has varied enormously , with countries in East Asia doing better than most 
other countries.  We are still trying to develop better tests , therapeutics , and vaccines , which 
when developed must be shared with all who need them , not just those who can afford them . 
Developed countri es must work with the WHO at sharing information, tracking the spread of 
the virus , and mapping the measures for its containment as well as ensuring that the best of 
science and technology, shared throughout the world. A global problem requires a global 
solution.  
 
5. The pandemic -generated lockdowns and other measures have devastated the 
economies of many countries. In 2020 the global economy is contracting significantly, with the US and Europe contracting even more. Firms rush to cope with the challenge, by redesigning 
their supply chains, accelerating digitization,  and reducing employment. This has led to tens 
of millions of unemployed, and the rich countries’ governments have adopted enormous 
stimulus packages in the trillions of dollars to tr y to avoid or reduce bankruptcies of firms and 
provide sustenance for those who have lost their employment as a result of the pandemic.  
 
6. Meanwhile, these enormous stimulus packages are also an opportunity to promote a 
“Green Recovery” where government funding is used to transform the economy, not simply  
 
seek to recreate the past. Thus, this crisis presents a window of opportunity, a historic chance 
to universally transform all sectors in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals 
and the Paris Ag reement. We can rebuild in new ways  to make our economies and our 
societies more resilient to environmental challenges and future health crises such as the 
current pandemic.  
 
Education  
 
7. Education is being transformed, with the introduction of digital technologies and 
distance learning, which challenge the conventional models of education systems inherited from the past. Rapid changes in both science and technology mean that lifelong continuous training is needed to avoid the constant social dislocation of older workers. Science and 
technology are essential for driving innovation but are not enough to solve major and complex 
challenges like the rise in non- communicable diseases, issues of social inequality , or climate 
change. To develop solutions that take into account culture, tradition, and geopolitical reality, 
science and technology must be better integrated with human and social sciences.  
 
Energy and Environment  
 
8.       In the wake of this pandemic, society has the opportunity to sustain a significant part of 
the savings in fossil fuel consumption achieved during the period when travel was restricted 
in order to accelerate toward a low -carbon future, aiming for a more energy -efficient society. 
In this context, nuclear energy, including small modular reactors (SMRs), remains a potentially 
important source for baseload electricity generation, under strict conditions of safety, security, and non- proliferation. Invest ment is needed in advanced technologies for low -emission energy 
sources, including hydrogen, reliable energy storage, massive electrification, and negative carbon emissions such as carbon capture and utilization. A proper framework of market -based 
policies  and incentives will be needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , and IT-based 
energy management systems will be essential for efficiently balancing sustainable energy 
supply and demand with minimum damage to the environment, including protection of 
biodi versity and movement towards precision agriculture to  ensure food and nutrition security 
for a growing global population undergoing the stresses of climate change.  
 
The ICT Revolution, AI , and Society  
 9. The ICT revolution continues apace with robotics, AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 
cloud computing all evolving rapidly. AI builds on the availability of large sets of digital data and profits from the recent conceptual and practical advances in the domain of machine 
learning. However, AI should neither be reduced to only its technical aspects nor delegated 
solely to computer scientists and engineers. It is important to address AI from multiple 
perspectives. All sciences, including the humanities and the social sciences, can contribute to 
better unders tanding the possible applications and consequences of AI and ultimately improve 
the design of tools built from AI. Scientific organizations should contribute to helping decision-makers and the general public understand the implications, benefits, and potential risks of AI.  
 
Global Governance of Information  
 
10. Data is not only a source of corporate and national competitiveness  as well as of 
scientific and medical progress ; it is also a force driving economic development. However, 
problems including growing economic disparity due to huge enterprises’ data oligopoly, severe violations of privacy, and promotion of discrimination or biases through intended/unintended 
misuse of personal information have emerged. Rising anxiety and distrust toward information 
caused by fake news expanding through media, including social networking services, and so-
called “infodemics,” which has become evident especially during the COVID -19 pandemic, 
pose major challenges to fundamental values like stability, mutual trust, and res pect for human  
 
dignity. It is important to build a frame of reference enabling ethical, trustworthy, and 
proportionate use of personal data to address these issues.  
 
Inclusive Participation  
 11. Inclusive participation in decision- making can be a key enabler to success. But around 
the world, systemic inequality is prevalent. From an economic standpoint, companies with 
more diverse leadership have been shown to be more successful. Various barriers, which may 
include structural challenges, access to services like childcare, access to education, cultural 
expectations or bias, stand in the way of achieving diversity with inclusivity. Governments and 
societies should actively work to overcome such barriers. Our discussions at STS on the lights 
and shadows of science and technology in society help move us in that direction.  
 
12. We look forward to convening again next year in Kyoto and have agreed to hold the 
18
th Annual Meeting of the STS forum  from Sunday, October 3 to Tuesday, October 5 , 2021.   "

Science and Technology in Society forum  (STS forum ) 
18th Annual Meeting  
Kyoto, Japan, October 5, 2021  
 
STATEMENT  
 
1. The 18th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum  took place from October 2 
to October  5 live online from a base studio in Kyoto, with online participation of around 1,400global 
leaders in science and technology, policymaking, business, and media from 125  countries, regions, 
and international organizations.  
 
Analysis and Synthesis in Science—Earth and Commons  
2. Humanity  today  is at a critical juncture . For a very long time,  many of us  believed that  our economic 
development had been supported by a stable and resilient Earth system —our global commons.  But 
the reality is that we have pushed the carrying capacity of this system to the breaking point.  Earth’s 
climatic, ecological, and human systems are converging towards an existential crisis  for global 
civilization within the lifetime of children now living. To build a  sustainable, inclusive,  and resilient 
future, we  must  find ways to change how we live,  and how we interact with the ecological systems 
we are all part of.  We need to transform key economic systems and look for new social norms, so 
that we can be stewards to  the global commons.  Global governance is needed not only to manage 
the global commons , but also to assess the revolutionary changes that are coming in science and 
technology and how their deployment can help or harm different aspects of our lives.  
 Breaking Silos in Education 
3. In terms of  human activit y, our knowledge base has shown the greatest growth
 from the 20th century 
onwards . However, knowledge is in a chaotic state, just like the pieces of a huge jigsaw puzzle. 
Education must break  down  the silos of organizations, subjects,  or regions so that we can create a 
multidisciplinary approach to deal with the com plex issues of our time and cultivate our ability to 
overcome known and unknown challenges  and attain the double goal of solving societal challenges 
while nurturing human resources.  
 Global Pandemic  
4. Pandemics have always been part of human history; still , the COVID -19-pandemic came as a 
surprise to the entire world,  and we must continue to confront the emergence of more virulent  strains. 
At the same time, the threat of new pandemics is always with us.  It has become obvious that effective 
systems of global disease surveillance, rapid reporting,  and early warning are essential for  
preventing pandemics.  Quick and effective communication is key in fighting a pandemic , starting 
with health care providers, and among scientific experts from both academia and industry . The 
science community must have an open dialogue with policymak ers and ensure that clear messages 
are communicated to the public.  
 
5. New or recent discoveries and approaches in biology , for example,  mRNA vaccines and the use of 
CRISPR technologies in testing, have had a major direct impact on dealing with the pandemic . While 
science has been critical for vaccine development, understanding viral spread,  and developing 
treatment, there have been many challenges. The impact of the pandemic has been felt by those directly affected, the health system, and national economies , and on global interactions and supply 2 
 
chains. The pandemic has taught us that we need collaborati ve systems  that work in a crisis.   It 
has also taught us that we must confront anti -science misinformation that uses social media and 
other platforms to obst ruct the effective deployment of vaccines and remedies.  
 
Advanced and Precision Medicine 
6. Driven by new approaches such as bioinformatics and synthetic biology, medical technology is currently making great strides. The fusion of polymer chemistry and life sciences has created new 
drug delivery systems, which are expected to contribute to combatting central nervous system 
diseases. The mRNA vaccine, a possible game changer in the fight against COVID -19, was promptly 
and successfully developed by bringing together the best of these advanced technologies. We must discuss the advantages and disadvantages advanced science and technology bring to human life 
and health and how we can deal with them.  
 Energy and Environment  
7. The 26
th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) will be held in Glasgow, UK next 
month, calling for speeding up all countries’  climate change efforts. Green investment  is also gaining 
momentum in the business community . Nevertheless , additional efforts must be made to accelerate  
energy efficiency,  provide access to clean electricity , and decarbonize industry and transportation. 
In particular, radical actions will be required, including strong incentives such as forcing users to pay 
the full environmental cost of their energy consumption, and targeted state interventions will be 
needed if we are to have significant reductions in the use of fossil fuels. The impact of significant 
changes in energy use on economic activity must be minimized by improving the quality of energy 
management , expanding renewable energy , and using hydrogen systems, storage battery systems, 
and possibly Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).  
 Resilient Society  
8. Across the planet, societies are currently confronted with multiple challenges including the COVID -
19 pandemic, increasingly frequent extreme weather events, and escalating degradation of the 
biophysical environment. While these impacts are occurring across the planet, the ways in which 
they manifest themselves are highly location specific . For this reason, societies must find ways to 
adapt and develop resilience in the face of the specific challenges they face.
 Building resilience at 
the community level wi ll require a convergence of science, technology, and social sciences with 
input from and engagement with civil society .  
 
Nurturing Talent in Developing Countries  
9. We discussed the various ways in which science and technology can be encouraged, taught , and 
moved into practice in the often- challenging environments of the developing world.  In addition to just 
learning and becoming excited about science, ways in which practical outcomes through business 
development and research opportunities can both stimulate and nurture a love of science and 
technology and lead to true economic benefits  were explored.  Universities , businesses, and other 
developed- world institutions  should  engage with young people in developing countries by providing 
opportunities for visi ts, advanced education,  and collaborative endeavors that  can benefit all parties.  
 
Collaboration 3 
 
10. The United Nations ’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a call for action by all countries in 
a global partnership to combat the urgent challenges we face . But these challenges interact among 
themselves , sometimes in a conflicting manner,  and no goal can be truly dealt with in isolation of 
action on the others. Global issues  cannot be addressed by any single nation or institution acting 
alone. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cannot be achieved without strong,  
coordinated collaboration between governments, industry, and academia.  We must continue to 
strengthen this collaboration within and between nations  to address current and future global threats.  
 
Digital Economy  
11. It is widely recognized that digitalization has unleashed a new wave of innovation with profound 
implications for existing economic models and that have impacted  businesses, public organi zations, 
and personal life.  Emerging digital technologies such as the  Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, 
and Big Data will lead to further disruptive innovation,  creating many benefits for consumers and 
businesses  on the one hand, but also generating new problems and policy issues  on the other . In 
particular,  AI has a wide range of potential economic and social implications , including new forms of 
economy and governance.  An appropriate ethical and legal framework  is needed to ensure  that 
digital technologies are designed and deployed in an inclusive and transparent  manner.  
 
12. We look forward to convening again next year in Kyoto and have agreed to hold the 19th Annual 
Meeting of the STS forum  from Sunday , October 2  to Tuesday, October 4, 2022 . "
2022,"- 1 - 
 Science and Technology in Society forum  (STS forum ) 
19th Annual Meeting  
Kyoto , Japan, October 4, 202 2 
 
STATEMENT  
 
 
1. The 1 9th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum  took place from October 2 to 4, 2022  in Kyoto, 
with the participation of nearly 1,000 global leaders in science and technology, policymaking, business, and media from 
over 80  countries, regions, and international organizations.  
 
Challenging times:  
2. We met in the shadow of conflict and the shifting tec tonic plates of the global international order, at a time when 
humankind faces great and complex global challenges. Science must play a central role to help the world move on beyond 
the pandemic and get back to the path of sustainable development. This willr equire that science, government and the private 
sector, working with communities and within a global -regional -national and local framework of multi -disciplinarity and 
collaboration to achieve the transformation of our economies to carbon neutrality. We must also keep the human being at 
the center of our concern s. We must remain committed to human rights and human dignity.  Globally, more equality and 
inclusion are needed for all humans.  We also have  to understand the complexity of the individual human being,  to 
comprehend a person’s mind, not just their brain.  
 
Analysis and Synthesis in Science –The Human Body and Mind  
3. Humans are a physical -biological entity  whose  bodies include  the brain with its myriads of neural cells and their 
connections. But what makes us human is the, apparently, non -physical entity –the mind, which includes our consciousness, 
way of thinking , and emotions. Many people, including scientists  and policymakers , are realizing that a central challenge 
confronting science in the 21st century is understanding the human mind in biological terms. Biology and neuroscience have 
generated an astonishing amount of information, but great effort must still be invested in a nalyzing and synthesizing that 
information . Furthermore , we also need to link advances in biology and neuroscience to research in psychology, social 
sciences and other related fields. This requires a clear vision in policymaking, funding schemes , and training of young 
scientists.  
 
Breaking  Down  Silos in Research  
4. As the world moves on to the post -pandemic stage, unprecedented challenges  are arising . COVID -19 highlighted the 
presence of many existing global issues, such as the vulnerability of the global supply chain and social inequality between 
the Global North and South in terms of access to the necessary vaccines and medical treatment. As these issues are by 
nature interdisciplinary, spanning fields from science and technology to the social sciences and humanities, researchers in 
various disciplines must collaborate  to address them.  Effective col laboration between research institutes and the public and 
private sectors is necessary, as is the creation of  an environment that supports interdisciplinary research and fosters 
communication between researchers in different fields.  
 
Lights and Shadows of AI 
5. Rapid ad vances in computing and robotics are opening new vistas. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fast developing into one 
of the most transformative technology  advances  in history . AI is rapidly increasing in power, precision, and scope of possible 
applications . It is helping humans undertake many complex tasks from optimizing network traffic to cataloguing images 
from newspaper archives. But more importantly , it is already helping solve many difficult scientific problems, such as 3D 
protein  folding , which will accelerate the development and deployment of new technologies and increase the speed of 
scientific adva nce across a wide range of disciplines. But concerns have increased about the extent to which AI may be 
amplifying existing human bi ases and other weaknesses in decision making, and what to do about the risks of autonomous 
action by AI, especially in the area of weapons . A whole new domain is developing around the ethics of work on and with 
AI. What AI does must be explainable and understandable. AI is definitely one of the areas where the lights and shadows 
of science and technology  in society is most compelling. Collaboration between governments, policymakers, and 
researchers is important to ensure that the development of AI is trustworthy, transparent, and responsibly deployed.  
 
Energy and Environment  
6. Recent IPCC working group reports point to a future where the likelihood of restraining the global mean temperature to 
a rise of 1.5 degrees seems increasingly improbable. We need to go from promises to action now. We also need to prepare 
for unavoidable cl imate -related impacts and provide concrete analysis of the steps needed  to avoid worse  outcomes . Climate 
change and disruptions in the hydrological cycle along with loss of biodiversity, deforestation , and increased pollution as 
well as densification of hu man settlements through increasing urbanization constitute converging risks , that require actions 
at the global, regional, national and local levels. Such programs for adaptation and resilience require  adequate funding for 
the poor countries as well as collaboration between knowledge providers and networks that can take and support action , 
above all, to avoid suffering due to poverty in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) , we also must take special 
measures to protect women, children, minorities, refugees , and other especially vulnerable groups.  
 
 - 2 - 
 7. With the increasingly rapid advance of the impacts of climate change, we face the urgent global need to shift from our 
fossil fuel -based energy economy to a new, sustainable system . The time remaining to address this existential problem is 
frighteningly short, and we need a clear and practical roadmap for this crucial transition. The expansion of renewable energy 
sources is fundamental. This roadmap could also include the utilization of natural gas and nuclear energy as transitional 
energy sources. the development of technology should also accompany  expansion of novel approaches to clean energy.  
However, as we monitor CO 2 emissions , we must also look at the inad vertent or even willful  release of greenhouse gases, 
especially methane. Over 100 countries have  already decided to slash methane emissions by 30% by 2030.  
 
Food and Water Security  
8. The world’s food and water supplies are set to face increasing pressure.  Climate change, urbanization , and resource 
scarcity are expected to have severe long -term effects on agriculture production yields and will also put more pressure on 
global food and water supplies , especially in the arid and semi -arid zones. Food and water security are inextricably linked. 
Achieving food and water security has always been challenging and will require us to transform our water use and 
agricultural practices. Food and nutrition security goes beyond adopting technology to taking  a systemic approach, from 
environmentally -sound production by smallholder farms to dist ribution and outreach . Countries need to consider the 
synergies across the food, nutrition, water, energy, and waste nexus  while simultaneously  doing this in a sustainable way . 
All this needs strong political will and wide public support.  
 
Preparing for the Next Pandemic  
9. While we continue coping with the ongoing COVID pandemic, it is also necessary to prepare for the next. A pandemic 
affects large  parts of the world at the same time, and the world’s ability to cope depends on the policies and practices of 
local, national, and international institutions. Success depends on deeper scientific understanding of everything from 
virology and immunology to  epidemiology and the psychology of human behavior.  Collaboration , including expanded 
public -private partnerships, are needed to develop, produce, and distribute new tests, therapeutics  and vaccines in an 
equitable and efficient manner. Success  also depends on maintaining proper monitoring, which requires investment in public 
health capabilities all around the world. To produce the needed plans  and preparations will need political will and public 
understanding . Success must also avoid inequities in resources, services, access, vulnerabilities , and outcomes arising 
within and across national borders .  
 
10. By its nature a pandemic is global, and hence the WHO must have a  stronger  science-based central role in coordinating 
global monitoring and action. It should also have the means to help those who need help most. Existing health funds should 
be restructured into a new Global Health Fund , maintaining past programs but adding new funding for financing  
commodities for disease control, pandemic preparedness and response, and primary health system strengthening in LMICs.  
 
Collaboration  
11. Today, some of the biggest challenges affecting innovation and development revolve around coping with post-pandemic 
effects and redesigning work -life arrangements, supply chains, inclusive growth, rapid demographic change, rural -urban 
transitions, increasing demand for natural resources, globalization and economic liberalization, climate change , and 
technological disruption. Academia  and the  public and private sectors will need to work together nationally and regionally 
to build and accelerate science and technology  and innovation . Collaboration  in such endeavors can bring many benefits,  
including cost  savings through sharing administrative expenses, expanding value propositions, improving efficiency, 
strengthening programs , and making use of compatible skills and abilities.  
 
STEAM Education  
12. Addressing real-world problems will require integrating education in arts subjects (including social and economic 
sciences and business) into STEM education, resulting in what is now commonly known as STEAM education. The use of 
inquiry -based  science education pedagogical  platforms for integrated STEAM education promotes the critical thinking, 
creativity , and problem -solving skills of students and young researchers. International  collaboration is essential for building 
capacity , solving global problems, exchanging best pra ctices , and promoting diversity and inclusion.  
  
Challenges in the Digital Society  
13. The revolution in the scale and speed of communication and the massive growth of information and the proliferation of 
social media platforms have created a new digital society and have changed where and how people access news and 
information about scientific, political, and societal issues.  However, these same attributes have also created a crisis of 
confidence where misinformation and disinformation spread rapidly, which is extremely detrimental to people and even 
more seriously, erodes trust in science, institutions, and government. Citizens need to be empowered to protect their privacy  
and reputation and to exercise critical judgment to recognize fact -based rep orting. A properly informed citizenry is 
necessary for adoption of science -based policies and evidence -based regulations.  
 
Conclusions:  
14. Our explorations  of these and other issues are far from over. We will continue our interactions and discussions to 
accompany the evolving lights and shadows of science and technology in the societies of the world. And  we look forward 
to convening again next year in Kyoto and have agreed to hold the 20th Annual Meeting of the STS forum  from Sunday, 
October 1 to Tuesday, October 3, 202 3. "
2023,"- 1 - 
 Science and Technology in Society forum  (STS forum ) 
20th Annual Meeting 
Kyoto, Japan, October 3, 2023 
 
STATEMENT  
 
1. The 20th Annual Meeting of the Science and Technology in Society forum  took place from October 1  to 3, 2023  in Kyoto, 
with the participation of nearly 1,500 global leaders in science and technology, policymaking, business, and media from over 
80 countries, regions, and international organizations.  
 
Artificial Intelligence  
2. One of this year's revolutionary advancements is the emergence and rapid progress of generative AI. This innovation signif ies 
progress in science and technology, offering the potential to connect disparate fields of knowledge, extract essence from eac h, 
and integrate them in previously unimaginable ways. However, integrating AI into daily life presents risks and challenges. We 
must carefully evaluate the technology , recognizing both its potential and its challenges, to ensure  that its benefits are 
univer sally shared and not divisive.  
 
3. The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had a transformative impact, but its  dependence on vast internet-fed human 
data raises concerns about bias, job displacement, misinformation, and opacity in algorithms, challenging various aspects of 
society. Despite its potential, many experts worry about embracing AI without addressing the se issues, underscoring the need 
for a clear approach as humanity deepens its collaboration with machine -based intelligence . 
 4. The advancement of AI also holds significant potential to revolutionize the field of healthcare. However, obtaining large -
scale  medical data can be challenging and may suffer from incompleteness or bias. the quality of data used to train AI 
algorithms is also crucial for their accuracy. These issues highlight the need for establishing frameworks and ongoing 
monitoring to expand the benefits of AI in the field of healthcare.  
 Digital Equity  
5. Digital technology has facilitated and transformed almost every aspect of our lives, including communication, education, research, business, and healthcare. However, since the beginning of this digital revolution, its impact has been uneven and 
currently, about one -third of the world's population remains unconnected to the internet. Unequal access and distribution of 
digital technology limit individual opportunities and deprive the global community of diversity in ideas and contributions that 
drive innovation. Finding ways to bridge the digital divide is an urgent challenge.  
 Trust in Information   
6. In contemporary society, trust in information is indispensable for personal choi ces, business decisions, and government 
policies. Various risks challenge this trust, from  misinformation and disinformation to biases and lack of transparency. Data 
manipulation and ethically questionable research also erode trust in information sources, as do security breaches . Ultimately, 
distrust in information exacerbates social and political divisions, hindering constructive dialogue and decision-making. These 
risks  must be acknowledged and addressed  through policy-making and multifaceted collaboration.  
 
Climate Change  
7. There is a broad scientific consensus that increased CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere  is a driving force behind climate 
change. Despite commitments from countries worldwide to reduce emissions, we have yet to reverse the trend of increasing emissions. To achieve net-zero emissions within the necessary timeframe and avoid unacceptable environmental consequences, 
we require technology development, infrastructure investment, and polic y changes. The industrial sector poses the most 
challenging and time -consuming task in terms of decarbonization due to its complex energy use. Considering the difficulty of 
complete decarbonization in some sectors, we must explore negative emissions options to offset remaining emissions.   But 
these efforts at mitigation of GHGs  emissions, must be accompanied by expanded efforts at adaptation and resilience,  especially 
for the poorest and most vulnerable populations, who are already suffering  the consequences of the  extreme weather events.  
 Food and Water Security  
8. With the evidence of global warming now incontrovertible, and ever-increasing amounts of  greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere, food and water security in the global system are central to the well -being and potential survival of many millions 
of people. Climate change is only one of many stressors on the global system, among them environmental destruction and 
regional and global conflict, all in the context of increasing incidences of natural disasters.  
The food and Agricultural Sector is currently the major consumer of water withdrawals, and is also a major emitter of GHGs.  - 2 - 
 Yet it also has enor mous wastage and much  of the food produced never reaches the consumer. Thus mobilization of new 
technologies, from genetically improved crops to the use of remote  sensing and ICT to optimize soil, water and nutrient 
management , in a Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) and precision agriculture is essential.  
 
Biodiversity 
9. A 2005 report by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment found that 60% of global ecosystem resources  were degraded or 
unsustainably used. In 2019, the Intergovernmental Platform on Science -Policy Advice on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services  
warned that one million out of eight million species are threatened with extinction. Despite a 2010 plan to halt biodiversity loss, 
none of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets were met by 2020. After four years of negotiation, the Kunming-Montreal Global 
Biodiversity Framework was adopted in December 2022, aiming to protect biodiversity, restore ecosystems, and safeguard 
indigenous rights . It set a goal to putting 30% of the planet under protection by 2030 and increasing financing for developing 
nations, emphasizing the vital role of the private sector  in addition to government responsibilities.   The global Gene Banks 
are a vital resource for humanity, and the very large collections of accessions need to be fully genetically analyzed and 
catalogued, to increase the searchability and analytically driven utilization of the sample accessions.  
 Preparing for the Next Pandemic  
10. Preparing for the inevitable next pandemic is the highest priority for humanity . The rate at which zoonotic infections are 
affecting human populations is likely accelerating, primarily associated with climate change , and thus monitoring diseases in 
both wildlife and domesticated animals is crucial. To ensure quick delive ry of tests, vaccines and treatments  in an unfolding 
pandemic , rapid sharing of data and sequence information is vital.  Testing, tracing, and containing any new pandemic are 
essential, as are  establishing research protocols and infrastructure and keeping them on standby in preparation for the next 
pandemic.   Much greatere quity in the access to tests, vaccines and therapeutics should be ensured for all regions and people.    
 Basic Science  
11. Today, we face ever greater challenges: climate change, food security, increasing energy demand, rising social inequalities 
or the outbreak of epidemics are just some examples. Science has a key role to play in addressing such complex issues, and curiosity -driven research helps lay the foundations for more effective approaches to meet these challenges. Basic research can 
lead to breakthrough innovations, but requires certain framework conditions in order to fully develop its innovative potentia l, 
which are often not adequately mirrored in policy goals. Sufficient funding doubtlessly is an important aspect for basic research 
to flourish, but policy agendas must also focus on creating optimum conditions allowing for basic research to be translated into 
applica tion and innovative technologies.  
 Collaboration  
12. Collaboration among industry, academia, and government is essential for advancing science and innovation in the modern 
knowledge -based economy, harnessing the strengths of each sector to drive progress, economic growth, and societal 
advancement. Industry brings market insights and resources, academia provides theoretical frameworks and environments for 
knowledge exploration, and government offers regulatory frameworks, funding, and a macro-level perspecti ve on national 
priorities. However, the tripartite model has its challenges such as power imbalances and sometimes conflicting goals. To 
address power imbalances among tripartite collaborators and mitigate risks of technology misuse or abuse, there is a need to 
cultivate an environment of stakeholder inclusion, open discussion, promotion of interdisciplinary solutions and building 
regula tory frameworks that facilitate effective cross- sector implementation.   International collaboration is also needed for 
developing scientific monitoring and early warning systems as the world faces ever more risks.  
 Space Utilization  
13. Fifty years on from the completion of the Apollo program, the frontier of space is finally opening up. Access to space, 
previously monopolized by a few superpowers, is becoming increasingly open to the general public due to the proliferation of 
commercial enterprises.  At the same time, using space for security and surveillance purposes has expanded. Global accessibility 
to space promises increased international cooperation, economic opportunities, new types of technological innovations, advanced communication, comprehe nsive environmental monitoring, and scientific advancements. However, challenges 
related to governance, ethical dilemmas concerning surveillance safeguards, and the potential for militarization will arise. Cooperation and collaboration are required to esta blish norms and regulations that promote the peaceful and equitable use of 
space.  
 
14. Our explorations  of these and other issues are far from over. We will continue our interactions and discussions to accompany 
the evolving lights and shadows of science and technology in the world. We look forward to convening again next year in 
Kyoto and have agreed to hold the 2 1
st Annual Meeting of the STS forum  from Sunday, October 6  to Tuesday, October 8, 202 4. "
